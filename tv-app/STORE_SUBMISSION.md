# Store Submission Guide — GameStop Movies TV

## How to Get the Build Files

### Option A — GitHub Actions (recommended, free)

1. Go to **github.com/C022IN/gamestop-kenya → Actions**
2. Pick a workflow:
   - **Build TV App (Local APK)** — Android TV, package `ke.co.gamestop.movies`, Leanback launcher
   - **Build Phone App (Local APK)** — Android phone, package `ke.co.gamestop.movies.phone`, portrait
3. Click **Run workflow** → choose `preview` (APK) or `production` (AAB) → Run
4. Wait ~15 min, then download artifacts from the run page:
   - Preview: `gamestop-tv-apk-<sha>` / `gamestop-phone-apk-<sha>` (sideloadable APK)
   - Production: `gamestop-tv-aab-<sha>` / `gamestop-phone-aab-<sha>` (Play Store AAB)

> **Important — signing:** The current Gradle workflow signs release builds with Expo's
> auto-generated debug keystore. APKs from this workflow **install fine via sideload**
> (Fire TV / Android TV / Hisense) but are **NOT acceptable for Google Play Store**.
> To make a Play-Store-ready build you need to wire a release keystore — see "Add
> release keystore" below.

**Add release keystore (only required for Play Store submission):**
1. Generate a keystore locally:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v \
     -keystore gamestop-movies.keystore \
     -alias gamestop-movies \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```
2. Base64-encode it: `base64 -i gamestop-movies.keystore | pbcopy`
3. In GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions → New secret:
   - `TV_KEYSTORE_BASE64` = the base64 string
   - `TV_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` = your keystore password
   - `TV_KEY_ALIAS` = `gamestop-movies`
   - `TV_KEY_PASSWORD` = your key password
4. Add a "Decode keystore" step to `build-tv-apk.yml` and a `signingConfig` block in
   `tv-app/android/app/build.gradle` (not currently wired — open a follow-up task).

### Option B — Codemagic (easier Play Store integration)

1. Go to **codemagic.io** → Sign in with GitHub
2. Add repository `C022IN/gamestop-kenya`
3. Codemagic detects `codemagic.yaml` automatically
4. Upload your keystore in Codemagic → Settings → Code signing → Android
5. Add Google Play JSON credentials for auto-publish
6. Click **Start build**

## Pre-Play-Store Checklist (REMOVE BEFORE PUBLISHING)

The current build contains one feature that violates YouTube's Terms of Service
for Play-Store-distributed apps and **must be removed** before submission to
Google Play. It is acceptable for sideload distribution and internal testing.

### What needs to go

**Hero auto-preview** — silently autoplays a muted YouTube trailer inside the
home-screen hero banner ~2.5 seconds after a slide stabilises. YouTube's
embedded-player policy forbids unattended autoplay outside YouTube apps; Google
Play has pulled apps for this in the past.

### Where to remove it

1. `tv-app/src/components/HeroBanner.tsx`
   - Delete the `WebView` import and the `fetchTrailerKey` import.
   - Delete the `trailerKey` / `showTrailer` / `trailerOpacity` state and
     associated `useEffect` blocks (search for "Trailer auto-preview").
   - Delete the `<Animated.View>` block that wraps `<WebView>` between the
     backdrop and the gradient (it has a `// Trailer auto-preview overlay`
     comment marking it).
   - Drop the `PREVIEW_DELAY_MS`, `PREVIEW_FADE_IN_DELAY_MS`, and `trailerView`
     style constants.

2. `tv-app/src/api/client.ts`
   - Delete the `fetchTrailerKey` function and its TOS-warning comment block.

3. `src/app/api/movies/videos/route.ts`
   - Delete this file outright. No other code depends on it.

4. `src/lib/tmdb.ts`
   - `getVideos` becomes unused. Either leave it (harmless) or remove for
     cleanliness.

### Smoke test after removal

- Home screen still loads with the rotating hero, logos, parallax, etc.
- Detail screen unaffected (it doesn't use trailers).
- `npm run typecheck` (or `npx tsc --noEmit` in `tv-app/` and the repo root)
  passes.

The rest of the build — episode list, Continue Watching, scrubable player,
subtitle/audio pickers, accent-tinted Play button — is fully Play-Store-safe.
